// G2 save-slot key resolver. The actual walk lives in

// AInGameGameState is the in-game UWorld's GameState. It carries
// `PlaythroughGuid` (FGuid, 16 bytes) at offset 0x032C
// (`Maine_classes.hpp:28544`). This is the same stable GUID used to
// disambiguate saves on disk. Exactly what we need as a
// persistence filename key.
//
// Earlier attempt used `USaveLoadManager.SaveInProgressSaveGameHeaderData`
// at +0x90, but that field is null except during an active save
// operation. AInGameGameState is the right surface for "we're in a
// world, give me the playthrough id."
