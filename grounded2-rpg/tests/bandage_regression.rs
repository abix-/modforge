// Regression fence: impact_resistance must not block healing.
//
// USER EXPECTATION: bandages (and other healing items) work
// regardless of which RPG skills are active.
//
// Failure mode this catches: any future regression that
// reintroduces a binary mask or other heal-blocking gate while
// impact_resistance is enabled. The previous bug
// (`RequiredDamageTypeFlags = 0xFFFFFFFF`) blocked bandages
// because their HoT tick (Type=Health (24) status effect)
// routed through native code that consults the mask.
//
// What this asserts (post-fix 2026-05-09):
//   1. mask is NOT 0xFFFFFFFF when impact_resistance is enabled
//      at any level. (The skill must NOT write the mask.)
//   2. Calling AddHealth on the player heals normally with
//      impact_resistance enabled. (Heals are not gated by the
//      skill.)
//
// Stays in the suite forever as a fence.
