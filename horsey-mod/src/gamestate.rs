//!
//! Safety:
//! - The game's main thread mutates GameState constantly. Reads
//!   from our HTTP worker are NOT synchronized with the game's
//!   per-frame update. For atomic-sized fields (uint32 etc.) the
//!   read sees a single coherent value; for multi-field
//!   structures (e.g. the 6-supply array) a snapshot may capture
//!   mid-update state. That's acceptable for the control-plane
//!   use case.
//! - Writes from the HTTP worker (e.g. `set_money`) MAY race with
//!   the game's own writes. For cheat-style mutations (money
//!   bump, year jump) the win-by-last-writer outcome is what the
//!   user wants. For state-machine mutations, we'll queue them
