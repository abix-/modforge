//! Regression test for `gamestate::ptr()` deref correctness.
//!
//! Background: the `.data` slot at `DAT_1403fb0d8` is a POINTER to
//! a heap-allocated GameState. The decomp evidence is unambiguous:
//!
//!   - `FUN_14009c6a0:46` heap-allocates 0x448 bytes via
//!     `FUN_1402c704c`, constructs in place, then stores the heap
//!     pointer into the slot.
//!   - `FUN_1400fd580:86` (the in-place constructor) does
//!     `DAT_1403fb0d8 = param_1` (param_1 is the freshly-allocated
//!     buffer).
//!   - `FUN_14009c4e0:26` zeroes the slot on destruction.
//!
//! A prior fix attempt mis-interpreted the slot as the struct
//! itself (no deref) after a stale value (`0x2400000000B`) crashed
//! the deref in main-menu state. Removing the deref hid the crash
//! but caused every field read to return random `.data` bytes
//! adjacent to the slot. This test exists so that bug can never
//! re-land silently.
//!
//! Strategy:
//!
//!   - Always-on: with no save loaded, `gamestate.diag` must report
//!     a self-consistent state. Either `ptr == 0` (the slot deref
//!     produced a null or rejected-as-implausible pointer) AND
//!     `verdict_looks_loaded == false`, OR both flip to "loaded"
//!     coherently.
//!
//!   - `MODFORGE_EXPECT_LOADED=1`: the user has told us "I am in a
//!     real save right now." Then:
//!       * `ptr` MUST be non-zero (deref succeeded).
//!       * `ptr` MUST look like a heap address (not `.data`-adjacent).
//!       * `money`, `year`, `sleeps` MUST be within bounded ranges
//!         that real saves produce. NO exact-value match (that
//!         violates the "only money is given" rule and is what the
//!         previous Claude fell into). Just structural bounds.
//!       * `verdict_looks_loaded` MUST be true.
