//! Regression test for "year and sleeps flicker to byte-pattern
//! garbage" seen 2026-05-15.
//!
//! Symptom: pre-fix, the HTTP snapshot reported `world_loaded: true`
//! whenever the rebased GameState struct existed in `.data` (always),
//! and the year/sleeps reads returned whatever bytes happened to be
//! at offsets 0x314/0x318. During main-menu / transient states the
//! game writes a fill pattern there, producing values like
//! year=16842752 (0x01010100) and sleeps=65793 (0x00010101).
//!
//! Two-pass contract:
//!
//!   Pass 1: at main menu (no save loaded), `world_loaded` MUST be
//!   `false` and `money/year/sleeps` MUST all be `null`. Without
//!   this, the UI bleeds byte-pattern leaks into the display.
//!
//!   Pass 2 (when actually loaded, future): consecutive snapshots
//!   taken < 100ms apart must report stable year + sleeps (game
//!   advances at a sleep cycle, not per-frame). Sanity bounds:
//!   year < 10_000, sleeps < 10_000_000. Year=16842752 fails this
//!   trivially.
//!
//! The harness drops us at the main menu, so Pass 1 runs in CI. Pass 2
//! is gated on `world_loaded` so it skips harmlessly when no save is
//! loaded.
