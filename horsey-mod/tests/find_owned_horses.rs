//! Validate the owned-horse chain GS+0x438 -> +0x90 -> +0x130/+0x138.
//!
//! Auto-launches the game via modforge::harness. The harness assumes the
//! configured Steam save loads automatically (vanilla Horsey behavior:
//! last-played save is restored on launch).
//!
//! The investigation test before this one proved that GS+0x280/+0x288
//! is a 26-entry pool of 36-byte inline summary records, NOT the
//! owned-horse list. Decomp `FUN_140107510:156866-156869` and
//! `FUN_14010de40:160376` traverse the +0x438/+0x90 chain to get the
//! real owned vector<Horse*>.
//!
//! This test calls `gamestate.owned_horses` (mod-side traversal with
//! is_addr_readable guards at every hop) and reports count + per-horse
//! fields.
//!
//! Modes (env-driven):
//! - default: assert count > 0 and per-horse fields plausible.
//! - `HORSEY_EXPECT_OWNED=<N>`: strict; assert count == N. Use this
//!   when the save has a known horse count and we want regression
//!   coverage that the GS+0x438 chain still resolves correctly.
