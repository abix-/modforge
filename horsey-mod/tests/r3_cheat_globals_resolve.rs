//! R3 batch 1: pattern-scan-resolve the cheat globals AND validate
//! every resolved address against the hardcoded one via a memory-
//! aliasing probe.
//!
//! Each global is a single byte in `.data`. The resolver finds it
//! via a sleuth signature for an instruction that references it.
//! Validation: write a sentinel at the hardcoded address and read
//! back via the resolved address. If they're the same byte the
//! sentinel round-trips. The probe is atomic (writes, reads,
//! restores) and uses TWO distinct sentinel values (0xAB then 0xCD)
//! so we catch both fixed-value and partial-aliasing false-positives.
//!
//! Contract:
//!   1. `targets.resolve.cheat_globals` returns the resolved
//!      address + the hardcoded RVA for each global.
//!   2. If the resolver returns a non-null address, `mem.alias_check`
//!      between hardcoded and resolved MUST report `same_byte: true`.
//!      Mismatch means hardcoded and resolved point at DIFFERENT
//!      bytes; one of them is wrong. Test fails loud with both
//!      addresses + the read-back values so the user can diff.
//!   3. If the resolver returned null (sig didn't match this build),
//!      the global is logged as "still hardcoded" and skipped.
//!
//! The test does not modify game-visible state: the probe writes
//! 0xAB / 0xCD transiently, then restores the byte to its original
//! value. The window is ~3 atomic byte writes; if a game frame races
//! during that window the cheat flag might flicker for one tick.
