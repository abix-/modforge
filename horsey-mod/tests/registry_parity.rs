//! Parity test: every target in `horsey::targets_registry::HORSEY_TARGETS`
//! resolves correctly against the live game image AND the resolved
//! address agrees with the corresponding legacy `targets::resolve::*`
//! function (where one exists).
//!
//! This is the gate that catches drift between the declarative
//! registry (new path) and the hand-rolled resolvers (legacy path)
//! during the B2 -> B4 migration. Once every horsey-mod call site
//! is on the registry and B4 is complete, the legacy half can be
//! deleted and this test becomes a pure registry-resolves check.
