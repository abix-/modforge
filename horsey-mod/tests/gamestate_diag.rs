//! Forensic test for `gamestate::looks_loaded` against live game state.
//!
//! Replaces ad-hoc curl probes with an in-tree test that:
//!
//!   1. Runs `gamestate.diag` against the running game.
//!   2. Logs the full dump to the per-run harness log so failure
//!      diagnosis is the test artifact, not a Discord screenshot.
//!   3. Asserts internal consistency that MUST hold regardless of
//!      whether the user is at the main menu or in a save:
//!
//!        - `verdict_looks_loaded` equals `roster.looks_loaded` (they
//!          are the same function; this catches accidental drift).
//!        - `fields.money/year/sleeps` are u32-valued (Some). The
//!          struct is mapped, so reads can't return None. The
//!          "garbage values when not loaded" problem is a SEMANTICS
//!          issue, not a read failure.
//!        - When `verdict_looks_loaded` is true, `roster.count_if_sane`
//!          is `Some` and < 2560 (the bound the heuristic enforces).
//!        - When `verdict_looks_loaded` is false, EITHER the roster
//!          span is bogus OR the count exceeds the bound. We assert
//!          one of those is true so a future bug that makes the
//!          heuristic flip without explanation gets caught.
//!
//!   4. Cross-check against `MODFORGE_EXPECT_LOADED`: if the env var
//!      is set, the user has told us "I am in a save right now."
//!      The test then DEMANDS `verdict_looks_loaded == true` and
//!      fails loudly with the diag dump if it isn't. This is the
//!      regression test for the 2026-05-15 false-negative the user
//!      hit ("I have a save running but the UI says no save loaded").
//!
//!      Without `MODFORGE_EXPECT_LOADED`, the test only checks
//!      internal consistency, so CI runs (which sit at the main
//!      menu) still pass cleanly.
