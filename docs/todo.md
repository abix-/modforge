# modforge workspace open issues

Survivalist extraction means moving existing engine-independent code out of the mod. Do not invent new planner, queue, registry, definition, or state types just to generalize it. Prefer direct code moves and small pure functions over new framework APIs. Survivalist keeps its existing game-specific control flow, Unity access, content, and behavior. An extraction row is complete only when the reusable code has moved without adding a speculative system.

| Priority | System | Todo | Done when |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | MISERY player input | [x] Write the Rust executable-analysis research test for keyboard input | `misery-mod/tests/research_player_input.rs` finds the live player's controller, PlayerInput object, input component, key-to-action mappings, and key state data, and prints them for analysis. Pure discovery, no bot input. |
| 1 | MISERY player input | [x] Find InputKey and call it to inject a virtual W press | SOLVED via prior art (bl-sdk): InputKey is EnhancedPlayerInput vtable slot 88 (RVA + 0x42f5970), called as `vtable[88](epi, &FInputKeyParams)` with the correct struct layout and a real FKey. Proven by `find_inputkey_slot_via_iskeydown`: after the call IsInputKeyDown(W)=true, after release=false. BUT `test_inputkey_movement` showed it does NOT move the character: ForwardInput action stays 0. MISERY movement runs on Enhanced Input actions; use InjectInputForAction (next row). research.md section 31. |
| 1 | MISERY player input | [x] Move the character via Enhanced Input action injection | SOLVED and verified live: `StartContinuousInputInjectionForAction(ForwardInput, FInputActionValue(1.0, Axis1D), [], [])` on EnhancedInputLocalPlayerSubsystem walked the character 677 units; `StopContinuousInputInjectionForAction(ForwardInput)` stopped it. BlueprintCallable UFunctions on EnhancedInputSubsystemInterface, called via the `call` op (ProcessEvent, no crash). `test_inject_action_movement`. research.md section 31. |
| 1 | modforge input research | [x] Build the write/exec hardware watchpoint ("find out what writes/runs at this address") | `modforge::winproc::capture_write_watchpoint` + the `watch_writes` op arm a CPU debug register across all threads and record each hit's instruction and call chain as image-relative offsets. Verified live: arms 123/123 threads, last_err 0. Committed. |
| 1 | MISERY player input | [x] Disprove the prologue-scan InputKey candidate | An exec breakpoint on the candidate (RVA + 0x320d680) fired zero times while W was tapped; a control fired 14 times. The candidate is never run on input. Recorded in research.md section 31. |
| 1 | MISERY player input | [~] Decode the KeyStateMap on EnhancedPlayerInput to find the W FKey entry's address | In ONE session a per-key FKey->FKeyState TSet block at EPI + 0x788 received W's FKeyState write on a press (24 writes), FKeyState 0x18 past the FName. CAVEAT: the block is found by a runtime heuristic scan and a later run found DIFFERENT blocks (+ 0x1D0, + 0x538, + 0x548) with no writes, so the + 0x788 offset is NOT confirmed reproducible. Store RVA + 0x42f25d0 is stable. |
| 1 | MISERY player input | [x] Write-watch the W KeyStateMap byte to capture the store and its call chain | Tapping W caught 24 writes from the game input thread. Store instruction + 0x42f25d0 (a shared setter); input-thread caller functions + 0x11aee60, + 0x3cb9360, + 0x39f1210, + 0xf87b70, + 0x10dc360, + 0x3213800. `find_inputkey_by_param` then showed NONE of these carries W's FKey, so InputKey is NOT among them (it is higher up the stack). research.md section 31. |
| 1 | MISERY player input | [ ] Identify InputKey by the parameter it receives, not its chain position | `name_inputkey_by_rcx` narrowed to input-thread functions + 0x39f1210 (this = controller) and + 0x3cb9360 (this = EPI), but `decode_inputkeyparams` showed + 0x39f1210's arg is a UObject container, NOT FInputKeyParams, so the earlier "InputKey = + 0x39f1210" naming is RETRACTED. Find the frame whose incoming arg holds W's FName index + W's FKeyDetails pointer (from the KeyStateMap W entry); that frame is InputKey. research.md section 31. |
| 1 | modforge input research | [x] Guard the read_bytes and write_bytes ops against bad/code pointers | Both ops `VirtualQuery`-check every page before the copy. Proven by `read_op_guards_bad_pointer`: reads and writes of 0x1, 0xDEAD00000000, 0x7FFFFFFF0000 return a clean error and the game survives. Committed. |
| 1 | MISERY player input | [ ] Hook the real InputKey to capture a byte-exact FInputKeyParams from a physical W press | Once InputKey is identified by its parameter, the real block is recorded from a live press so the bot replays real bytes instead of a guessed struct. |
| 1 | Ueforge input | [x] Send key press, held state, and release exactly as MISERY sends player keyboard input | `UnrealInputSurface::key` maps W/A/S/D/E to Enhanced Input actions and holds them via Start/StopContinuousInputInjectionForAction. Verified live through `input.player.commands`: W/A/S/D each walk the character ~200-243 units (`test_bot_all_keys`). |
| 1 | MISERY input proof | [x] Run a permanent live test of the exact player W input mechanism | `test_bot_input_wired`: W via input.player.commands walks the character 270 units, release stops it, positions recorded. |
| 1 | MISERY player input | [x] Investigate exactly how MISERY handles real player mouse movement | Mouse look is the TurnInput (yaw) and LookupDownInput (pitch) Enhanced Input actions, driven by relative mouse delta. research.md section 31. |
| 1 | Ueforge input | [x] Send relative mouse movement exactly as MISERY sends the player's mouse input | `UnrealInputSurface::move_rel` injects TurnInput/LookupDownInput via InjectInputForAction. Verified live: mouse dx=200 turned the view 180 degrees (yaw 90 -> 270). No rotation write, no cursor move. |
| 1 | MISERY input proof | [ ] Add and run a permanent live test of the exact player mouse-input mechanism | The test observes the retained player's view before and after input and fails unless the requested mouse movement changes it. |
| 1 | MISERY input proof | [ ] Add and run a permanent live test of the exact player E input mechanism at a door | The test aims at an in-range door, sends E through the verified player mechanism, and fails unless MISERY's existing binding changes the observed door state. |
| 1 | Ueforge input | [ ] Release every held key when input stops, fails, is cancelled, or shuts down | Unit tests and a restarted live failure case prove W/A/S/D/E are released and the player does not continue moving or interacting. |
| 1 | Ueforge input | [ ] Drive a given player's controller, not only the retained local player: Enhanced Input through that player's own subsystem where the game uses it, legacy InputKey at the PDB-located address where it does not | A live test presses W through the second player's controller in Abiotic Factor and its character moves while the human's does not; MISERY's existing W test still passes. |
| 1 | Ueforge symbols | [ ] Add a PDB reader (the `pdb` crate, not yet added) that, given a PDB path, prints a symbol's image-relative address and a struct's field layout | A test prints APlayerController::InputKey, UPlayerInput::InputKey, and the FInputKeyParams layout from Abiotic Factor's shipped PDB. Not started. |
| 1 | Ueforge second player | [ ] Create a second local player through the engine's CreatePlayer and hand its character to modforge as the AI player's body | A live test in Abiotic Factor prints the second character and its controller and the game keeps running. |
| 1 | Ueforge settings | [ ] Turn split-screen off through the game maps settings default object before a second local player exists | The byte reads 0 after the write, live in Abiotic Factor. |
| 1 | Ueforge observation | [ ] Observe any given character, not only the retained local player: position, view, health | The observation of the second character in Abiotic Factor matches what the game shows. |
| 1 | Ueforge world | [ ] List the nearby things around a given character with kind, position, and state, from class names the game crate supplies | A live test lists containers, doors, and enemies within 3000 units of a character in Abiotic Factor. |
| 1 | modforge ai_player | [ ] Define the AI player's view of the world as plain data: its own position, view, health, and needs, plus nearby things with kind, position, and state, filled by the engine connection each step | A unit test builds a view from fixture data and the picker reads it with no engine code. |
| 1 | modforge ai_player | [ ] Pick the next goal by need: each nearby thing advertises how much it satisfies each need, scored by urgency and path cost; the needs are eat, drink, sleep, heal, arm, get stronger, and get closer to out; nothing nearby means explore | Unit tests: hunger high picks the food container; hunger low picks the cheaper path; nothing nearby picks an unexplored place. |
| 1 | modforge ai_player | [ ] Run one AI player step: refresh the view, pick a goal, make it the route's next waypoint, travel with the shared bot, act on arrival, record the event | A unit test with a fake engine connection drives one step from a fixture view to an arrival and an event record. |
| 1 | modforge ai_player | [ ] Keep the event log and memory in one file per save: events with who, what, where, and when; containers seen and opened; enemies seen; grudges that decay | A unit test writes events, reloads the file, reads back the same events, and a decayed grudge is gone. |
| 1 | modforge ai_player | [ ] Step the AI player along its path without physics when far from the human, at walking speed times elapsed time, never past a door it cannot open or a gap with no link | A unit test on a fixture path: position advances by speed times time, needs still change, a locked door stops it. |
| 1 | modforge ai_player | [ ] Continue after death: when the engine reports the AI player dead, wait for the game's own respawn, then resume from the new position with memory intact | A unit test reports death then a new position through a fake connection, and the next step resumes with the old memory. |
| 1 | Unityforge second player | [ ] Read how Schedule 1's multiplayer stack spawns a second player character, since Unity has no engine-level second player | A doc names the function that spawns a second player character in Schedule 1, or records that the game has none. |
| 1 | Ueforge navigation | [ ] Return a complete Unreal navigation path to Modforge in the shared path format | Ueforge owns the Unreal navigation call and returns path points without making MISERY decode or steer through Unreal navigation itself. |
| 1 | MISERY navigation | [ ] Run the complete spawn-to-metal-door-to-expedition test through real player input | For each selected waypoint, Unreal A* returns a complete path and the bot travels it through the verified W/A/S/D, relative mouse, and E input path. |
| 1 | MISERY performance | [ ] Measure the complete live input and route test for repeated work | Input performs no repeated player, function, or object searches; the existing timing report shows every measured bot operation below 16.7 ms. |
| 1 | Unityforge player input | [ ] Investigate and use exactly how the Unity game handles real player keyboard and mouse input | A Unity test receives the same ordered player-input commands as Unreal through the exact functions and data used by that game's player input. |
| 1 | Unity bot navigation | [ ] Run one live Unity waypoint trip through the shared Modforge bot-navigation system | The bot receives a complete Unity path, travels it through player input, performs one bound interaction, observes success, and releases all input. |
| 1 | MISERY interaction | [ ] Aim from the active player camera at the bunker door's colliding-bounds center and press `E` only when the bounds are within interaction range and the door allows interaction | Three consecutive restarted runs open the bunker door once without looking at the floor or requiring manual input. |
| 1 | MISERY interaction | [ ] Open the traversed crate with player `E` input and observe its retained storage state | The crate reports an active user without searching for a container window or another UObject. |
| 1 | MISERY interaction | [ ] Transfer the crate contents through the real inventory UI action | The retained crate item count falls and the retained player item count rises after player-like input. |
| 1 | MISERY performance | [ ] Extend the existing scoped timing guard across the complete spawn-to-looted-crate run | Timing disables after success or panic; `ue:find_object`, `ue:find_objects_by_chain`, `ue:find_actors_by_chain`, and `ue:objects_read` are absent; every measured bot operation remains below 16.7 ms. |
| 1 | MISERY acceptance | [ ] Run and document the permanent cold spawn-to-looted-crate acceptance | One restarted run enters the expedition, selects and reaches a real crate, opens it, loots it, releases input, and records the verified result in the owning docs and changelog. |
| 2 | Ueforge navigation | [ ] Read the navigation mesh's polygons and the edges that have no neighbor from the Recast/Detour tile data, using struct layouts from the PDB reader | A live test prints the polygon count and one tile's edges on Abiotic Factor's player-sized mesh. |
| 2 | modforge links | [ ] Generate jump, drop, and crouch links from mesh edges with no neighbor, given the character's jump speed, gravity, capsule size, and safe drop height, and store them in a file per level | A unit test on fixture edges produces the expected links; a live test walks one generated jump link with the AI player's character in Abiotic Factor. |
| 2 | modforge links | [ ] Record the human player's own jumps as links: where the player left the navigation mesh and where they rejoined it | After one play session the links file holds recorded links with start and end; a unit test rejects a link whose ends lie on the same mesh polygon. |
| 3 | `wwm-mod` | [ ] Verify the hot-reload cycle works in-game: launch WWM, observe gen 0 ready, run build_and_deploy.ps1 -Hot, watch BepInEx log for hot reload 0 -> 1, confirm curl ops still answer | Hot-reload verified in-game. |
| 3 | `wwm-mod` | [ ] Fix the janky jump: investigate PlayerController per-frame movement to find what clobbers position/velocity; likely needs a Harmony prefix on the per-frame movement method to inject a jump-velocity boost | Jump feels correct and reliable. |
| 3 | `wwm-mod` | [ ] Ship UnitySkillProxyEffect and repoint Strong Back at SkillsManager.SetSkillLevel("Bag", N) (the game already grows the slot list; verified live 5->12 slots) | Strong Back uses the game's built-in Bag skill API. |
| 3 | `wwm-mod` | [ ] Research Charisma + Resilient mappings: neither has an obvious built-in game-skill match; either find a custom proxy through the existing four or write a raw-field Effect against GameDataSO fields | Charisma and Resilient skill effects documented and implemented. |
| 3 | `wwm-mod` | [ ] Verify Greedy Miner in-save: walk_class MineDataSO to confirm field names (zero instances at main menu; SOs instantiate with a save) | Greedy Miner confirmed working in a loaded save. |
| 3 | `horsey-mod` | [ ] horsey sleep_safe_no_tire patch site discovery: find_patch_site cannot uniquely identify the +0x206 zero-store inside the no_tire loop at FUN_1400ceb60; next idea: walk back from DAT_1403d95c5 read and pick the FIRST +0x206 store that follows it | Patch site uniquely identified and sleep_safe_no_tire NOP applied. |
| 5 | `modforge` | [ ] One additional consumer mod (grounded2-mod or schedule1) adopts at least one testkit primitive to prove the abstraction works cross-game | Second consumer uses modforge::testkit. |
| 5 | `modforge` | [ ] Document modforge::testkit in modforge/docs/ (currently only module-level rustdoc) | testkit documentation in modforge/docs/. |
| 5 | `horsey-mod` | [ ] B4a sig tuning: 5 targets still hint-only (SAVE_VERSION_GLOBAL, RACES_COUNTER, NO_TIRE_TOGGLE, RETIRE_HORSE_HANDLER, BALLOON_CONTROLLER); author candidate signatures for each | All 42 registry entries have real candidate sigs (100%). |
| 5 | `modforge` | [ ] Update modforge/docs/target-registry.md from design-doc to shipped-API doc | target-registry.md reflects shipped API. |
| 5 | `horsey-mod` | [ ] Reduce targets.rs from 1286 LOC to pure TargetDef data (remaining LOC is fn_addr, gs_offset, horse_offset modules) | targets.rs is pure TargetDef data. |
| 5 | `survivalist-mod` | [ ] Exercise the Load/Unload re-init path live: trigger a story SWITCH (not quit-to-menu) and confirm the ReinitAfterUnload path works | Story-switch re-init verified live. |
| 8 | `horsey-mod` | [ ] I-R1: Decomp grep for input read sites in all_functions.c (GetCursorPos, GetAsyncKeyState, SDL_*, etc.) to determine which OS surface Horsey uses | Input surface documented; L1/L2/L3 viability decided. |
| 8 | `horsey-mod` | [ ] I-R2: Locate mouse-state globals (expand from hk1.probe.mouse_globals); pattern-resolve via targets | Mouse-state globals pattern-resolved. |
| 8 | `horsey-mod` | [ ] I-R3: Locate keyboard-state globals (likely a 256-byte VK array next to GetAsyncKeyState call sites) | Keyboard-state globals located. |
| 8 | `horsey-mod` | [ ] I-R4: Identify the click dispatcher (HK1 found FUN_1400de2e0 for drop-commit; need the equivalent for any-click) | Click dispatcher function identified. |
| 8 | `horsey-mod` | [ ] I-R5: PostMessage smoke: does PostMessage(hwnd, WM_LBUTTONDOWN, ...) trigger an in-game click? | L2 viability confirmed or ruled out for Horsey. |
| 8 | `modforge` | [ ] I-3: Coordinate spaces: explicit input.client_to_screen + DPI awareness (L2 already uses client-area px) | Coordinate space conversions handle DPI correctly. |
| 8 | `horsey-mod` | [ ] I-4: L3 game-internal pokes v2: direct mouse-state struct writes via FUN_14018c5c0() accessor + direct keyboard buffer writes via FUN_140183330(0)+0xe1 | L3 input bypasses OS entirely for cursor and keyboard. |
| 8 | `modforge` | [ ] I-2b: input.state.get op that reads game's own mouse/keyboard state for verification (needs per-game InputSurface impl) | input.state.get returns game-side state for test verification. |
| 8 | `horsey-mod` | [ ] I-2d: HK1 Shift+Click migration: once calibration gives screen-to-game-coord ratio, ship input.combo with shift + input.mouse.drag | Shift+Click transfer uses modforge::input instead of custom vtable helpers. |
| 8 | `modforge` | [ ] End-to-end test exercising a click-driven flow (open Horses tab, click row 3, assert detail panel opens) | Click-driven UI test passes. |
| 8 | `modforge` | [ ] At least one second consumer (grounded2-mod or schedule1) wires up InputSurface for cross-game proof | Second consumer uses InputSurface. |
| 10 | `horsey-mod` | [ ] V4 validation: confirm 4 vanilla signatures work against live game (vanilla.list enumerates 4; vanilla.invoke on RNG_NEXT_MODULO returns u32 in [0,100)) | 4 vanilla function signatures verified live. |
| 10 | `horsey-mod` | [ ] V5: Migrate horsey-mod call sites that invoke vanilla code to vanilla::call (FUN_1400b3070 rebuild, FUN_1400c6580 RNG, any new direct invocations) | Production call sites use Invoker::call_safe instead of transmute. |
| 10 | `modforge` | [ ] V6: Cross-game vanilla adoption: when grounded2-mod or schedule1 ships their first TargetRegistry, register one function with a Signature | Second consumer registers a Signature and invokes through Invoker. |
| 10 | `grounded2-mod` | [ ] In-game smoke test: game launches, ImGui tab opens, load save triggers slot activate, kill creature triggers XP, HTTP /debug responds | Full in-game acceptance passes. |
| 15 | `unityforge` | [ ] Handle-table namespace per generation: old gen's still-held handles are stale after swap; high-bit-encode the generation if collision matters | Handle collisions across generations impossible. |
| 15 | `unityforge` | [ ] Periodic GC of quiesced generations: _quiesced list grows forever; free GCHandle once gen's threads have exited | Quiesced generations cleaned up. |
| 15 | `ueforge` | [ ] simulate_apply_damage lift to ueforge::rpg::health (gated on Wave E1; ApplyDamageFromInfo from PE trampoline re-enters ProcessEvent and crashes) | simulate_apply_damage available as framework op. |
| 20 | `ueforge` | [ ] Parm decoders: lift per-UFunction parm block shapes from kill_hook / inv_hook / fall_hook into ParmDecoderDef + per-class registry + generic walk_parms debug op | walk_parms debug op works for any hooked UFunction. |
| 20 | `ueforge` | [ ] ClassRef registry: every declared static ClassRef could feed a workspace-wide class_refs_list op | class_refs_list op enumerates all declared ClassRefs. |
| 20 | `ueforge` | [ ] Annotate remaining ~50 undocumented unsafe blocks across ue/probe.rs, status_effect.rs, class_tweak.rs, core_types.rs, typed_field.rs, fname.rs, platform.rs, player.rs, discovery.rs, selector.rs, damage_info.rs, pe_call.rs, parms.rs, fstring.rs | clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks flipped to deny with zero warnings. |
| 20 | `ueforge` | [ ] Hot-reload torture test: 1000x Ctrl+R loop with hooks installed; assert no thread leak, hook leak, slot regression | Torture test passes 1000 cycles. |
| 20 | `ueforge` | [ ] zerocopy remaining sites: damage/mod.rs on_event (DamageHookConfig), data_table.rs decode_field, kill_hook/fall_hook/inv_hook parm decoders (~6 structs), FDataTableRowHandle (pointer) | All feasible sites use zerocopy derives. |
| 20 | `ueforge` | [ ] proptest remaining: FieldTweak decoder + inspect_address byte slabs | Property tests cover FieldTweak and inspect_address. |
| 20 | `ueforge` | [ ] insta per-op snapshots for the standard debug-op set (skill_toggle / spend / refund / etc.); gated on building a stateless test fixture | Per-op snapshot tests pass. |
| 25 | `ueforge` | [ ] UE-version-aware ffield / fproperty / ustruct offsets (hardcoded for UE 5.4; UE 5.5+ silently returns wrong names) | Offsets auto-detect UE version. |

## InputKey research: confirmed facts

These are verified facts from live testing. Do not repeat the failed approaches listed below.

### What InputKey IS

- `APlayerController::InputKey(const FInputKeyParams&)` is a native C++ virtual function.
- It is NOT a UFunction. Tested all three classes (PlayerController, PlayerInput, EnhancedPlayerInput) via `class_functions_by_name`. Zero matches. ProcessEvent cannot reach it.
- PlayerController has 162 UFunctions. Six are InputKey-related but read-only queries: `IsInputKeyDown`, `WasInputKeyJustPressed`, `WasInputKeyJustReleased`, `GetInputKeyTimeDown`, `GetInputAnalogKeyState`, `GetInputVectorKeyState`. All take FKey (24 bytes). None of them is InputKey itself.
- InputKey is in the vtable of both the controller and EnhancedPlayerInput objects.

### What the player chain looks like

- `live_player` (+0x2C8) -> Controller (+0x408) -> PlayerInput (EnhancedPlayerInput)
- EnhancedPlayerInput vtable has 120 entries. 16 are from the EnhancedInput plugin (slots 0, 9, 49, 87-99).
- ActionInstanceData at +0x598 on EnhancedPlayerInput is OUTPUT (writing to it does not move the player). Confirmed by `inject_forward_input` test.
- KeyStateMap is NOT in the +0x5E8 region. A write watchpoint on +0x5E8 / +0x5F0 caught zero writes on a key press; the earlier before/after diff there was a net change, not a store site. The real per-key FKey->FKeyState TSet is a separate heap block reached through a header on the object (see research.md section 31; the exact object offset is not confirmed reproducible).

### FInputKeyParams struct (unverified layout)

```
FKey (24 bytes):
  FName KeyName: comparison_index (i32) + number (u32) = 8 bytes
  TSharedPtr<FKeyDetails>: pointer (8 bytes) + ref count pointer (8 bytes) = 16 bytes
FVector2D Delta: likely double (UE5.4 LWC) = 16 bytes
float DeltaTime: 4 bytes
int32 NumSamples: 4 bytes
EInputEvent event: 4 bytes (0=IE_Pressed, 1=IE_Released)
FInputDeviceId: 4 bytes
bool bIsGamepadOverride: 1 byte + 7 padding
Total: 64 bytes (unverified, may be wrong)
```

### Failed attempts (do NOT repeat)

1. **Vtable slot guessing on EnhancedPlayerInput (slots 88, 94, 98).** Slot 94 crashed the game twice. The function at slot 94 reads `rdx+0xA8` (168 bytes into the params), which means it expects a struct much larger than FInputKeyParams (64 bytes). Slot 94 is NOT InputKey. Slots 88 and 98 were never tested because the approach was abandoned.

2. **Patternsleuth string xref for "InputKey".** Found the UTF-16 string "InputKey" at 17 locations in .rdata and the UTF-8 version at several more. Zero lea xrefs to any of them in .text. The function does not reference the string "InputKey" with a direct `lea reg, [rip+disp32]`. Also tried "APlayerController::InputKey", "IE_Pressed", "FInputKeyParams" as search strings. "APlayerController::InputKey" and "FInputKeyParams" not found in rdata at all. "IE_Pressed" found once but also zero xrefs.

3. **Prologue byte scan for controller vtable slot 130.** Found a unique match at `0x7ff6a4b0d680` for prologue `40 55 57 41 57 48 8d 6c 24 b9 48 81 ec f0 00 00 00 f6 41 58 10`. Called it on the controller with FInputKeyParams for W. Returned true, no crash, but player did not move. This function might be InputKey (it reads controller+0x1A0 which is PlayerInput, and delegates to PlayerInput vtable), but the call produced no movement. Possible cause: null TSharedPtr<FKeyDetails> in the FKey struct, or wrong FInputKeyParams layout.

4. **Calling controller vtable slot 130 directly.** Returned true but no movement. Nothing proves this function IS InputKey. The prologue scan found A function, not THE function.

### What is needed next

The address of `APlayerController::InputKey` must be found definitively, not guessed. Options that have not been tried:
- Check if MISERY ships with a PDB or has debug symbols
- Use RTTI (vtable[-1] has the MSVC Complete Object Locator with the class name) to map the controller vtable to known class hierarchies, then cross-reference with UE5.4 source for the InputKey slot index
- Hook a candidate function and verify it fires when a real physical W key press happens (requires knowing a candidate address, which we have from the prologue scan)
- Find what populates KeyStateMap (+0x5E8 on EnhancedPlayerInput) by scanning for instructions that write to offset 0x5E8, then trace the call chain backward to InputKey

### Write watchpoint: the method that works (2026-08-28)

Stop guessing addresses and calling them. Watch the memory a real
key press changes and read back which instruction wrote it. The
`watch_writes` op (`modforge::winproc::capture_write_watchpoint`)
arms a CPU debug register on the address across all threads, and
records each write's instruction plus stack call chain as
image-relative offsets. Verified live: arms 123/123 threads.

Tapping W caught 24 writes to the ForwardInput trigger byte
(ActionInstanceData entry + 0x10) from one instruction and one
call chain. The value at entry + 0x40 and the + 0x5E8 region
caught nothing, so those are not the key-press write target.
Captured writer (RVA into MISERY-Win64-Shipping.exe): instruction
+ 0x42f14d2; callers + 0xf590f8, + 0xf4dd41, + 0xf6682d,
+ 0x11af012, + 0x7bf8140, + 0x7be5918, + 0x3cb9443. This is the
Enhanced Input TRIGGER-evaluation path (it writes ForwardInput's
trigger byte), which runs AFTER raw key input, so it is NOT
InputKey. Full detail in `misery-mod/docs/research.md` section 31.
InputKey itself is still not located; see that section for the
open state.
