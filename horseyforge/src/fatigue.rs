//! Fatigue suppressor: per-frame loop that zeros only the
//! race-eligibility tiredness flag (`horse + 0x205`) on every
//! live horse, while leaving the sleep-gate flag (`horse + 0x206`)
//! alone.
//!
//! Why we don't use the game's built-in `no_tire` cheat
//! (`DAT_1403d95c5`): that cheat's per-frame loop at
//! `0x1400ce6c0`-area (line 121172 of decompiled/all_functions.c)
//! zeroes BOTH +0x205 AND +0x206. +0x206 is what the sleep
//! handler at `0x1400e0aa0` (line 131551-131573 of all_functions.c)
//! checks for "is any horse tired enough to need sleep". With +0x206
//! always zero, the player gets "None of your horses are tired"
//! and can't advance the day cycle.
//!
//! Splitting the two flags lets us:
//! - Race any horse, any time (race gate reads +0x205; we zero it).
//! - Sleep to advance day (sleep gate reads +0x206; we leave it).
//!
//! Implementation: a worker thread on a 50ms timer that walks the
//! horse list at GameState `+0x130/+0x138` and clears `+0x205`.
//! The game's own loop runs once per frame (~16ms at 60fps); ours
//! runs slightly slower but still fast enough that no eligibility
//! check sees a stale value.
