//! Monuments as topside design.md "Monuments" describes them: a
//! monument TYPE rolls which building types it includes from its
//! list, each building generates from parameters (room count,
//! floors, footprint, doors, windows, palette), the buildings sit
//! by an arrangement rule, loot spots, NPC spots, and gates come
//! with it, and even the name is random. Never the same twice.
//!
//! Like [`crate::item`] and [`crate::biome`]: modforge owns the
//! shapes ([`BuildingTypeDef`], [`MonumentTypeDef`]) and the
//! registries; the consumer registers which building and monument
//! types exist in its game. Engine-agnostic and deterministic: the
//! same seed rolls the same monument. The output is a
//! [`MonumentDef`] of plain [`StructureDef`]s; the consumer's
//! spawner places them.
//!
//! Prior art: Rust's monuments and its card rooms (the gates).
