//! The structure vocabulary: buildings as DATA. A StructureDef is
//! rooms (with openings and stairs), furniture, and lights; plain

//! generation produce the same shape.

//! Consumers own the spawner (the binder): topside turns a def into
//! Bevy entities; a mod would call its host game's build functions.
//! The relation rules live here in [`validate`] so every consumer
//! and every generator shares one idea of a legal building.
//!
//! Coordinates are structure-local: y up, north = negative z. Each
