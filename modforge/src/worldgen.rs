//! The world as data (topside design.md "The world"): a `WorldDef`
//! rolls a `World` from a seed, the way a MonumentTypeDef rolls a
//! monument. The roll decides the heightmap, a biome per cell,
//! monument sites, and roads between them; the consumer builds the
//! scene from it and the storm rolls a new one through the same
//! path. Engine-free: glam math, the `noise` crate, plain data.
//!
//! Prior art, read from source: Endless's worldgen.rs (continents
//! and world map styles: layered simplex elevation, edge falloff,
//! moisture, rejection-sampled sites with spacing) on Red Blob
//! Games' "Making maps with noise"; Rust's roads laid between
//! monuments over the heightmap by easy slope.
