//! Generic Steam-game test harness.
//!
//! Drives the full repeatable loop: build the mod, kill any running
//! game instance, launch via Steam, optionally inject a DLL, poll the
//! mod's HTTP endpoint until ready, hand back a `RunningGame` handle
//! that exposes the HTTP API. On `Drop` or explicit `stop()` the
//! game process is taskkilled.
//!
//! Per-game tests wire this up via a `GameSpec` constant and a
//! `tests/common/mod.rs` helper. See `horsey-mod/tests/common/mod.rs`
//! for the reference consumer.
//!
//! Env vars honored:
//! - `MODFORGE_NO_GAME=1`: tests should skip with a clear message
//!   instead of attempting to launch. Helper: [`should_skip`].
//! - `MODFORGE_STEAM_EXE`: override Steam executable path. Default:
//!   `C:\Games\Steam\steam.exe` falling back to the
//!   `steam://rungameid/<app_id>` protocol handler.
//! - `MODFORGE_SKIP_BUILD=1`: assume the mod is already built; skip
//!   the `cargo build` step. Useful when iterating manually.
