//! The biome vocabulary: a biome as DATA. A BiomeDef is the generic
//! definition of a type of area (topside design.md, operator-locked:
//! biomes control weather, possible monuments, possible npcs,
//! wildlife, and probably more); a generator builds concrete areas
//! from it. Plain glam math and rgb, no engine types, like
//! [`crate::structure`].
//!
//! The lists name defs held by other registries (weather kinds,
//! MonumentDefs, npc kinds, wildlife kinds, ItemDefs); a biome only
//! says what is POSSIBLE here, never places anything itself.
