//! Shared R-tier assertion functions for any consumer mod's
//! `sleuth::TargetRegistry`. Replaces the per-game
//! `r2_function_resolvers.rs` / `r3_*_resolves.rs` /
//! `r4_field_offsets.rs` family with three reusable functions.
//!
//! Pattern: consumer mod's test file is a thin wrapper:
//! ```ignore
//! #[test]
//! fn registry_resolves() {
//!     let Some(game) = common::launch("registry_resolves") else { return };
//!     modforge::testkit::registry::assert_every_target_resolves(
//!         &game, &my_mod::HORSEY_TARGETS, &my_mod::HORSEY_RESOLVER,
//!     );
//! }
