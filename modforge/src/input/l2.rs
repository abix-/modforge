//! L2 backend: per-window synthetic input via `PostMessage` /
//! `SendMessage`.
//!
//! No focus theft, no cursor visibly moving on the user's desktop.
//! The target window must process the standard `WM_LBUTTONDOWN` /
//! `WM_KEYDOWN` family; raw-input games bypass these messages and
//! will ignore us (use L1 or L3 there).
//!
//! Coordinate convention: all `(x, y)` here are CLIENT-RELATIVE
//! pixels of the target HWND, packed into the `lParam` per the Win32
//! mouse-message convention.
