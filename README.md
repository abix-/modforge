# modforge

A Rust workspace for game mods. One foundation crate
(**`modforge`**), two engine-binding "forge" crates that adapt
it to a specific host runtime (UE5, Unity), and per-game mod
crates that consume modforge directly or through a forge.

```

An "engine forge" is reusable: any UE5 game sits on ueforge,
any Unity game sits on unityforge. A native-PE game has no
managed loader to lean on, so its per-game crate carries its
own injector + game-specific accessors and consumes modforge
directly. The first such crate is `horsey-mod` (Horsey Game).
If a second native-PE game shows up, the
`inject + HTTP-bind + binary-patch` pattern in horsey-mod
gets lifted into a shared `modforge::inject` module; until
then it lives where it's used.

## modforge. The foundation

Everything game-agnostic lives here: the localhost HTTP control
plane, the op registry, the selector grammar that lets ops
address running-process state by name, the RPG module
(`Effect` / `Trigger` / `Skill`), the scanner (typed memory
reads / writes / pattern scans), the winproc helpers (module
base, address-rebase, VirtualProtect), the per-line-flushed
log, the shutdown registry, and the settings file loader.

## The two engine forges

An engine forge is a thin crate that binds modforge into one
host *engine* runtime and contributes engine-specific
machinery only. Any game built on that engine sits on top.

### ueforge. UE5 / UE4SS

The first forge. Owns the UE SDK shim (UObject / UClass /
UFunction / GObjects / TypedField), the `ue4ss_mod!` macro,
the C++ shim, ProcessEvent vtable hooks with per-hook drain
on shutdown, ImGui bindings, hot-reload (Phase A + B), and
five opinionated mod-shape modules:

| Module     | What you write per-game                             |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| RPG        | A catalog of `Skill<E>` rows. 9 of 10 universal shapes covered by `StandardEffect`. |
| Stacks     | `StackTweak::new(table, offset, default_mult, skip)` |
| Difficulty | `DifficultyKnob::new(class, offset)` per knob       |
| Inventory  | `ViewportBinder` trait impl                         |
| Damage     | `DamageBinder` trait impl                           |

Test framework: `ueforge::client::{research, diff, scenario}`
collapses test boilerplate to Pester-style one-liners.

See [`ueforge/README.md`](ueforge/README.md).

### unityforge. Unity (Mono + IL2CPP)

Binds modforge into Unity games via a BepInEx-loaded
`Unityforge.Shim.{Mono,Il2Cpp}.dll` C# shim that LoadLibrarys
the per-game Rust cdylib and dispatches per-frame Update +
generation-versioned hot reload. Ships a Mono bridge
(reflection over loaded assemblies, Harmony patching,
GameObject / Component / field access), an IL2CPP bridge, and
a Unity-side Input bridge. Generation-versioned hot reload
(never `FreeLibrary`; each reload is a `LoadLibrary` of a
freshly-named gen file) avoids the FreeLibrary crash class.

See [`unityforge/`](unityforge/) and [`docs/unityforge-plan.md`](docs/unityforge-plan.md).

## Game-side mods

| Crate                     | Game              | Bound via    | What it does                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `grounded2-mod`           | Grounded 2        | ueforge      | Factorio-style RPG / level-up. 13 skills, target ~25.                        |
| `outworld-station-mod`    | Outworld Station  | ueforge      | Stack-size tweak (DT_Materials.MaxCanStack multiplier). Validates ueforge on a second UE5 game. |
| `wwm-mod`                 | Wild West Miner   | unityforge   | RPG / level-up + demo-end block (TutorialManager.CompleteDemo prefix). Mono. |
| `il2cpp-smoke`            | (smoke target)    | unityforge   | End-to-end test of the IL2CPP path before shipping a real IL2CPP game mod.   |
| `horsey-mod`             | Horsey Game       | modforge (PE inject) | Cheats + research surface. Sleep-safe fatigue suppressor, money/year/horse ops, debug-mode unlock. Carries its own injector EXE. |

`horsey-mod` is the odd one out: Horsey Game has no
third-party plugin loader, so the crate consumes modforge
directly and ships a small injector EXE that
`CreateRemoteThread`s a `LoadLibraryW` into the running
process. It also owns the binary-patch infrastructure
(VirtualProtect / write / FlushInstructionCache /
revert-on-detach) and hot reload via timestamped staged DLLs
(cargo's output is never the file the game has loaded, so
it's never locked). All Horsey-specific. See
[`horsey-mod/README.md`](horsey-mod/README.md) and
[`horseygame/`](horseygame/) for the Horsey Game research.

  catalog, persistence.

  former `horsey-mods` repo).

## Research tooling

### falcon-printer. Binary-to-Rust output backend (migrating to r2sleigh)

Sits next to the mod crates as a workspace member. Today
the implementation lifts stripped PE binaries through
[Falcon](https://github.com/falconre/falcon) and emits
Rust-shaped pseudocode via a small middle-end.

**Decision 2026-05-14**: migrate the substrate from Falcon
to [r2sleigh](https://github.com/radareorg/r2sleigh)
(radare2 org's pure-Rust SLEIGH decompiler with full
x86-64, SSA pipeline, real structurer, type inference).
The Rust-output goal stays; the engine underneath swaps
out for a more mature one. Phased migration plan in
[`falcon-printer/docs/strategy.md`](falcon-printer/docs/strategy.md).

Current Falcon-based status: **88.8% lift rate** on
10,332 Horsey functions. 11 sample artifacts shipped at
[`horseygame/decompiled/rust/`](horseygame/decompiled/rust/)
including `save_filename_format`,
`click_race_when_ready_dialog`, `simulation_paused_status`,
`price_or_score_formula`, `SDL_CloseSensor`. These are the
prototype output; the r2sleigh-based rewrite is expected
to push past parity on SSE-heavy and loop-heavy functions.

See [`falcon-printer/README.md`](falcon-printer/README.md)
for the one-page intro and
[`falcon-printer/docs/`](falcon-printer/docs/) for the deep
dives (architecture, passes walkthrough, coverage
methodology, the strategy migration plan, non-goals).

Per-crate docs live in each crate's `docs/` folder.

## Install (per game)

Each game-side mod has its own deploy command:

```sh
# Grounded 2 (UE5 / UE4SS)
cargo deploy install -p grounded2-mod

# Outworld Station (UE5 / UE4SS)
cargo deploy install -p outworld-station-mod

# Wild West Miner (Unity Mono / BepInEx)
wwm-mod/scripts/build_and_deploy.ps1

# Horsey Game (native PE / inject)
cargo build -p horsey-mod --release
target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/horsey-inject.exe \
  --dll target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/horsey.dll
```

`cargo deploy install -p <mod>` (for the ueforge mods)
auto-detects the Steam install via the
`[package.metadata.ueforge]` config in the crate's
`Cargo.toml`, copies the DLL + a default `settings.json` into
UE4SS's `Mods/` directory, and registers the mod in
`mods.txt`.

For Vortex packaging: `cargo deploy package -p <mod>` produces
a Vortex-installable zip in `dist/`.

### Hot reload

Each forge has its own hot-reload story:

- **ueforge**: Ctrl+R inside UE4SS. The framework swaps a
  side-file (`main-new.dll`) into place during `on_shutdown`;
  UE4SS reloads the new image. Hook teardown + thread joins +
  vtable restoration are framework-side. State on disk
  survives.
- **unityforge**: Generation-versioned. Run
  `wwm-mod/scripts/build_and_deploy.ps1 -Hot` to stage a new
  `*.unityforge.gen<N>.dll`. The C# shim's per-second watcher
  picks it up and `HotSwap`s. Old generation is quiesced (its
  code stays mapped); never `FreeLibrary`.
- **horsey-mod**: `horsey-inject.exe --reload`. POSTs
  `_shutdown` to release the listener, `CreateRemoteThread`s
  `FreeLibrary` on the old HMODULE, deletes the old staged
  file, stages the new build to a fresh timestamped path,
  loads it.

## Status (2026-05-14)

- **modforge**: foundation crate stable. Server with
  `SO_REUSEADDR` (hot-reload swaps bind cleanly), op registry,
  selector grammar, RPG primitives, scanner, shutdown
  registry, settings.
- **ueforge**: five framework modules shipped (rpg / stacks /
  difficulty / inventory / damage), hot-reload (Phase A + B)
  complete, Pester-style test DSL complete.
- **unityforge**: generation-versioned hot reload built and
  deployed (Phase 4). Mono + IL2CPP shims.
  `HarmonyBridge.PatchPrefix/Postfix` known-broken (queued for
  fix); Mono `MonoBridge.ListMethods` shipped (+ ABI v4).
- **horsey-mod** (Horsey Game mod, PE inject): injector +
  HTTP control plane shipped, hot reload works,
  `no_tire`-by-default replaced by split-flag fatigue
  suppressor (race-eligible without breaking sleep).
  Binary-patch infra landed; first patch
  (`sleep_safe_no_tire`) wip (pattern-scan disambiguator
  unsolved).
- **grounded2-mod**: 13 skills live including Lifesteal in the
  damage hook. Tested against Grounded 2 Steam build
  `++Augusta+release-0.4.0.2-CL-2673661`.
- **outworld-station-mod**: stacks tweak shipped.
- **wwm-mod**: demo-end block shipped (Harmony prefix on
  `TutorialManager.CompleteDemo`); RPG side parked while the
  Harmony bridge is repaired.
