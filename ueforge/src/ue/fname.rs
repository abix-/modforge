// offsets.append_string. Matches Basic.hpp:341.
//
// `to_string` caches by FName u64 to avoid re-running AppendString for the
// same name on every call. Each AppendString invocation leaks its FString
// buffer (we don't bind UE's FMemory::Free); the cache caps the leak at
// one buffer per unique FName. Bounded by the game's name pool size
// (~50K) instead of unbounded per call. See `fstring.rs`.
//
// The cache stores `Arc<str>` so cache hits return one ref-bump
// instead of a heap-allocating `String::clone`. Callers that need
// an owned `String` call `.to_string()` once at the boundary.
// same cost as before; callers that just compare or substring
// (e.g. `name.starts_with("Default__")`) save the allocation
// entirely.
