//! Mod metadata + entry-point wiring.
//!
//! Game crates declare a single `static MOD_INFO: ModDef = ...`
//! and call [`ue4ss_mod!`] once at the crate root. The macro emits
//! every `extern "C"` hook the shipped `ueforge_shim.cpp` calls
//! (`ueforge_mod_get_name`, `ueforge_mod_get_tab_count`,
//! `ueforge_mod_render_tab`, `ueforge_mod_dll_attach`,
//! `ueforge_mod_unreal_init`, `ueforge_mod_shutdown`), wires `DllMain`
//! into `ueforge::log::set_dll_module`, and initializes the logger
//! on `on_unreal_init`.
//!
//! Game side, in full:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! static MOD_INFO: ueforge::ModDef = ueforge::ModDef {
//!     name: "OWS Tweaks",
//!     version: "0.1.0",
//!     log_file: "ows_outworld_station_tweaks.log",
//!     console_title: "OWS Tweaks",
//!     console: cfg!(feature = "console"),
//!     on_unreal_init: || { ows::start(); },
//!     on_shutdown: || { ows::stop(); },
//!     tabs: &[
//!         ueforge::TabDef { name: "Tweaks", render: ows::render_tweaks },
//!         ueforge::TabDef { name: "Debug",  render: ows::render_debug },
//!     ],
//! };
//!
//! ueforge::ue4ss_mod!(MOD_INFO);
//! ```
//!
//! No `cpp/`, no `build.rs` C++ wiring, no DllMain. Ueforge ships
//! all of it.
