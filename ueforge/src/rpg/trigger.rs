//! UE-specific Engine + Event enum + concrete event-driven
//! triggers.
//!
//! The trait shapes (`Trigger`, `TriggerDef`, `TriggerCtx<E>`,
//! `OnSlotChange*`) live in [`modforge::rpg::trigger`]. This
//! file plugs in the UE engine:
//!
//! - [`UeEngine`]: the zero-sized type carrying the
//!   `Event<'a> = UeEvent<'a>` association.
//! - [`UeEvent`]: enum of UE event payloads (damage, kill, fall).
//! - [`TriggerCtx`]: type alias for
//!   `modforge::rpg::TriggerCtx<'_, UeEngine>`.
//! - [`OnDamageDealtTrigger`], [`OnDamageTakenTrigger`],
//!   [`OnKillTrigger`], [`OnFallTrigger`] + their static
//!   `TriggerDef`s.
//!
//! `OnSlotChange` is engine-agnostic; it's defined in modforge
//! and re-exported via [`crate::rpg::ON_SLOT_CHANGE`].
