//! HealthComponent simulation ops -- `simulate_add_health` and
//! `simulate_set_current_health`.
//!
//! ```text
//! K8s slot: Def=HealthBinding (game-supplied constants),
//!           Registry=ueforge::ops::OP_REGISTRY,
//!           Instance=per-call PE queue job,
//!           Controller=register() + per-op closure
//! ```
//!
//! Every UE5 RPG / survival game has a `UHealthComponent` (or
//! analogue) with a single `f32` "current damage" field plus a
//! handful of UFunctions that mutate it (`AddHealth`,
//! `SetCurrentHealth`, `ApplyDamageFromInfo`). The op handlers
//! that simulate those calls are universal in **shape**:
//!
//! 1. resolve a selector to the live HC instance,
//! 2. read the `current_damage` field for before/after telemetry,
//! 3. enqueue a PE call to the game-thread drain,
//! 4. inside the drain, build a parm struct + invoke the
//!    UFunction via `pe_call::call_ufunction`,
//! 5. read the after-value, return JSON with the deltas.
//!
//! The **constants**. HC class name, selector name, field
//! offsets, UFunction names. Are game-specific. Game crates
//! declare a [`HealthBinding`] with their values and call
//! [`register`] once at worker init. ueforge handles the rest.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! static HEALTH_CLASS: ueforge::ue::ClassRef = ueforge::ue::ClassRef::new("HealthComponent");
//!
//! static HEALTH_BINDING: ueforge::rpg::health::HealthBinding =
//!     ueforge::rpg::health::HealthBinding {
//!         hc_class: &HEALTH_CLASS,
//!         hc_selector: "live_player_hc",
//!         current_damage_offset: 0x032C,
//!         max_health_offset: 0x0328,
//!         add_health_function: Some("AddHealth"),
//!         set_current_health_function: Some("SetCurrentHealth"),
//!     };
//!
//! // From worker():
//! ueforge::rpg::health::register(&HEALTH_BINDING, &PE_QUEUE, PE_TIMEOUT_HINT);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Parm shapes
//!
//! The Maine SDK (Grounded 2) ships these UFunctions with parm
//! shapes that match every UE5 RPG HC we've inspected:
//!
//! - **`AddHealth(amount: f32, causer: *mut UObject)`**. 16-byte
//!   parm. `causer` may be null.
//! - **`SetCurrentHealth(desired_health: f32)`**. 4-byte parm.
//!
//! If a future game's HC exposes a different signature, generalise
//! the parm builder via a trait or callback. v1 hardcodes
//! Maine-canonical shapes.
//!
//! ## What is NOT shipped here
//!
//! `simulate_apply_damage`. The parm shape is `0x100` bytes with
//! an embedded `FDamageInfo`. Can re-enter `ProcessEvent` from
//! the engine's damage-replication path and crash the host. The
//! safe-drain-site work (Wave E1: global `ProcessEvent`
//! pre-callback) gates it. Until then, games that want the op
//! ship their own stub returning a "disabled, see ueforge docs"
//! error so tests can detect-and-skip.
