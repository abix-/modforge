//! Game-thread job queue.
//!
//! Many UE engine APIs (`UObject::ProcessEvent`, anything that
//! triggers replication, blueprint events, network RPCs) are only
//! safe to call from the game thread. The HTTP listener runs on a
//! worker thread, so `op` handlers that need to invoke those APIs
//! enqueue a job here and block on a reply channel until the game
//! thread drains and runs the job.
//!
//! The "game thread" is whatever thread drains this queue. In a UE
//! mod that's typically inside a ProcessEvent trampoline that fires
//! many times per second (a damage multicast, a tick UFunction, an
//! input handler. Pick one that's hot enough).
//!
//! Re-entrance: jobs themselves can trigger ProcessEvent fan-out
//! that re-enters the trampoline that's draining us. The `DRAINING`
//! flag is the guard. Re-entered drains see the flag and skip,
//! letting the outer drain finish without recursion.
//!
//! Counters / timing belong in the game crate. `len()` is a
//! lock-free hot-path check so the trampoline can early-exit when
//! the queue is empty. `drain()` returns `DrainStats` so the game
//! can feed its own metrics.
